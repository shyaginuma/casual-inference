# casual_inference

The `casual_inference` is a Python package provides a simple interface to do causal inference.
Doing causal analyses is a complicated stuff. We have to pay attention to many things to do such analyses properly.
The `casual_inference` is developed aiming to reduce such effort.

## Installation

```shell
pip install casual-inference
```

## Overview

This package will provide several types of **`evaluator`**. They have `evaluate()` and some `summary_xxx()` methods. The `evaluate()` method evaluates treatment impact by calculating several statistics in it, and the `summary_xxx()` methods summarize such statistics in some ways. (e.g., table style, bar chart style, ...)

The `evaluate()` method expects that the data which has a schema like as follows will be passed.

|unit|variant|metric_A|metric_B|...|
|----|-------|--------|--------|---|
|1   |1      |0       |0.01    |...|
|2   |1      |1       |0.05    |...|
|3   |2      |0       |0.02    |...|
|... |...    |...     |...     |...|

The table has been already aggregated by the `unit` column. (i.e. The `unit` column should be the primary key)

### Columns

- `unit`: The unit you want to conduct analysis on. Typically it will be user_id, session_id, ... in the web service domain.
- `variant`: The group of intervention. This package always assumes `1` is a variant of control group.
- `metrics`: metrics you want to evaluate. e.g., The number of purchases, conversion rate, ...

## Quick Start

The current version of `casual_inference` only supports evaluation of A/B testing and A/A testing.

### A/B test evaluation

```python
from casual_inference.dataset import create_sample_ab_result
from casual_inference.evaluator import ABTestEvaluator

data = create_sample_ab_result(n_variant=3, sample_size=1000000, simulated_lift=[-0.01, 0.01])

evaluator = ABTestEvaluator()
evaluator.evaluate(
    data=data,
    unit_col="rand_unit",
    variant_col="variant",
    metrics=["metric_bin", "metric_cont"]
)

evaluator.summary_plot()
```

![eval_result](examples/images/plot_abtestevaluator_result.png)

It diagnoses [Sample Ratio Mismatch](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330722) (SRM) automatically. When it detects the SRM, it'll display a warning on the output so that the Analyst can interpret the result carefully.

You can also see the [example notebook](https://github.com/shyaginuma/casual_inference/blob/main/examples/ab_test_evaluator.ipynb) to see more detailed example.

### A/A test evaluation

```python
from casual_inference.dataset import create_sample_ab_result
from casual_inference.evaluator import AATestEvaluator

data = create_sample_ab_result(n_variant=2, sample_size=1000000, simulated_lift=[0.0])

evaluator = AATestEvaluator()
evaluator.evaluate(
    data=data,
    unit_col="rand_unit",
    metrics=["metric_bin", "metric_cont"]
)

evaluator.summary_plot()
```

### Sample Size evaluation

```python
from casual_inference.dataset import create_sample_ab_result
from casual_inference.evaluator import SampleSizeEvaluator

data = create_sample_ab_result(n_variant=2, sample_size=1000000)

evaluator = SampleSizeEvaluator()
evaluator.evaluate(
    data=data,
    unit_col="rand_unit",
    metrics=["metric_bin", "metric_cont"]
)

evaluator.summary_plot()
```
